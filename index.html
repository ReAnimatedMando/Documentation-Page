            <p>Molding a performers face is the first step in changing their Face
                three dimensionally and turning them into any character or creature you
                could possibly imagine. Pouring plaster into a mold produces a duplicate
                of your performers face (a life mask) that you can then sculpt new features on.
            </p>
            <p>In the next few chapters we're going to go over how to make a mold of someones face.
                We will cover what materials and equipment you will need, the steps you'll need to take
                to prepare yourself and your model, how to safely apply the prepared material as well as remove it,
                and lastly we will go over how to make the final cast that you'll be creating your beautiful
                sculptures on.

            <p>Materials & equipment can vary depending on an artists personal preference
                as well as their process. The suggestions on this page are a great starting place.
                Get familiar with this way of doing things and as you grow, we encourage you to develop
                your own style.

            <p>When you choose a subject, make sure that they can commit to both
                the mold casting as well as the makeup as it would defeat the purpose
                to try and apply your makeup on a different person. Before the afformentioned person
                arrives you want to have all of your supplies set up and ready to go.
            </p>
            <p>Make sure your alginate and water are measured out and ready to be mixed at a 1/1 ratio.
                Your plaster bandages should be cut into 6 different sizes depending on where they
                will be placed on the face. All of these items should be placed on a nearby table 
                and sorted as such will make for the quickest application.
