            <p>Molding a performers face is the first step in changing their Face
                three dimensionally and turning them into any character or creature you
                could possibly imagine. Pouring plaster into a mold produces a duplicate
                of your performers face (a life mask) that you can then sculpt new features on.
            </p>
            <p>In the next few chapters we're going to go over how to make a mold of someones face.
                We will cover what materials and equipment you will need, the steps you'll need to take
                to prepare yourself and your model, how to safely apply the prepared material as well as remove it,
                and lastly we will go over how to make the final cast that you'll be creating your beautiful
                sculptures on.

            <p>Materials & equipment can vary depending on an artists personal preference
                as well as their process. The suggestions on this page are a great starting place.
                Get familiar with this way of doing things and as you grow, we encourage you to develop
                your own style.

            <p>When you choose a subject, make sure that they can commit to both
                the mold casting as well as the makeup as it would defeat the purpose
                to try and apply your makeup on a different person. Before the afformentioned person
                arrives you want to have all of your supplies set up and ready to go.
            </p>
            <p>Make sure your alginate and water are measured out and ready to be mixed at a 1/1 ratio.
                Your plaster bandages should be cut into 6 different sizes depending on where they
                will be placed on the face. All of these items should be placed on a nearby table 
                and sorted as such will make for the quickest application.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Preparing_subject">
            <header>Preparing Subject</header>
            <p>The absolute most important thing about preparing your subject is 100% mental.
                Sit them down and explain each step you'll be taking in detail and asure them that
                you can abort at anytime in the case of an emergency. Having your face buried under 
                thick paste and plaster is not fun and avoiding any surprises could be the difference
                between panic and trust. Also make sure that you constantly speak to your subject. Subjects
                will undoubtedly experience some claustrophobia and it goes a long way for them to be distracted
                and assured that you're always there.
            </p>
            <p>Once your subject is comfortable and confident in you as an artist you 
                can move on to the technical stuff. Sit your subject in a comfortable chair
                and cover them in a drop-cloth. Use adhesive tape to seal the cloth where
                it meats their skin. Apply a bald cap and mark their hairline with a black 
                eyebrow pencil. Coat any hair, i.e. eyebrows, lashes, or mustaches, with vaseline,
                cholesterol, or glue down with spirit gum. This will help the alginate release instead
                of removing the subjects hair. Lastly, make sure the subject is comfortable in a natural
                position as they will be stuck there until the mold is completed. Remind them that they
                should avoid any movement in their face.

            <header>Applying The Alginate</header>
            <p>Ok, your supplies are laid out and your subject is ready.
                Combine your 14oz of alginate and 14oz of water in a bowl 
                and start mixing. Stir slowly to avoid the powdery alginate 
                spilling over your bowl. Stir until there are no lumps, (should be less than a Materials_and_equipment).
                Now it is quicker and better to apply the alginate with your hand. Start 
                at the top of the forehead and work down to the brow. Before getting to the 
                eyes, apply a small amount to the pits between the eyes as well as the 
                top of the nose. Next cover the eyelids and eyebrows, working away from 
                the nose. Move on to the cheeks, along the jaw, and down 
                the neck. Lastly cover the mouth, upper nose, and the nose tip. From now until 
                the alginate sets you must keep a close eye on the nostril openings, making 
                sure they do not become blocked. If they do, have your subject blow out their nose
                as if trying to clear it. 
            </p>
            <p>Don't over think this process. You are prepared and ready to apply
                the alginate. Just keep an eye on your timer so you have an idea of 
                when your alginate is setting, you can also feel the alginate as it starts to 
                stiffen. Remember to constantly speak to your subject to reassure 
                them that you are there and calm and everything is going as planned.
