            <p>Molding a performers face is the first step in changing their Face
                three dimensionally and turning them into any character or creature you
                could possibly imagine. Pouring plaster into a mold produces a duplicate
                of your performers face (a life mask) that you can then sculpt new features on.
            </p>
            <p>In the next few chapters we're going to go over how to make a mold of someones face.
                We will cover what materials and equipment you will need, the steps you'll need to take
                to prepare yourself and your model, how to safely apply the prepared material as well as remove it,
                and lastly we will go over how to make the final cast that you'll be creating your beautiful
                sculptures on.

            <p>When you choose a subject, make sure that they can commit to both
                the mold casting as well as the makeup as it would defeat the purpose
                to try and apply your makeup on a different person. Before the afformentioned person
                arrives you want to have all of your supplies set up and ready to go.
            </p>
            <p>Make sure your alginate and water are measured out and ready to be mixed at a 1/1 ratio.
                Your plaster bandages should be cut into 6 different sizes depending on where they
                will be placed on the face. All of these items should be placed on a nearby table 
                and sorted as such will make for the quickest application.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Preparing_subject">
            <header>Preparing Subject</header>
            <p>The absolute most important thing about preparing your subject is 100% mental.
                Sit them down and explain each step you'll be taking in detail and asure them that
                you can abort at anytime in the case of an emergency. Having your face buried under 
                thick paste and plaster is not fun and avoiding any surprises could be the difference
                between panic and trust. Also make sure that you constantly speak to your subject. Subjects
                will undoubtedly experience some claustrophobia and it goes a long way for them to be distracted
                and assured that you're always there.
            </p>
            <p>Once your subject is comfortable and confident in you as an artist you 
                can move on to the technical stuff. Sit your subject in a comfortable chair
                and cover them in a drop-cloth. Use adhesive tape to seal the cloth where
                it meats their skin. Apply a bald cap and mark their hairline with a black 
                eyebrow pencil. Coat any hair, i.e. eyebrows, lashes, or mustaches, with vaseline,
                cholesterol, or glue down with spirit gum. This will help the alginate release instead
                of removing the subjects hair. Lastly, make sure the subject is comfortable in a natural
                position as they will be stuck there until the mold is completed. Remind them that they
                should avoid any movement in their face.

        <section class="main-section" id="Applying_the_alginate">
            <header>Applying The Alginate</header>
            <p>Ok, your supplies are laid out and your subject is ready.
                Combine your 14oz of alginate and 14oz of water in a bowl 
                and start mixing. Stir slowly to avoid the powdery alginate 
                spilling over your bowl. Stir until there are no lumps, (should be less than a Materials_and_equipment).
                Now it is quicker and better to apply the alginate with your hand. Start 
                at the top of the forehead and work down to the brow. Before getting to the 
                eyes, apply a small amount to the pits between the eyes as well as the 
                top of the nose. Next cover the eyelids and eyebrows, working away from 
                the nose. Move on to the cheeks, along the jaw, and down 
                the neck. Lastly cover the mouth, upper nose, and the nose tip. From now until 
                the alginate sets you must keep a close eye on the nostril openings, making 
                sure they do not become blocked. If they do, have your subject blow out their nose
                as if trying to clear it. 
            </p>
            <p>Don't over think this process. You are prepared and ready to apply
                the alginate. Just keep an eye on your timer so you have an idea of 
                when your alginate is setting, you can also feel the alginate as it starts to 
                stiffen. Remember to constantly speak to your subject to reassure 
                them that you are there and calm and everything is going as planned. 
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Applying_the_plaster_bandage">
            <header>Applying The Plaster Bandage</header>
            <p>Once the alginate has set you are ready to move on to the plaster bandages. Remind your
                subject to remain as still as possible. Your pre-cut slabs of plaster bandages will be laid 
                individually. This is done by grabbing one piece at a time, grabbing an end in each hand, dipping 
                it in warm salt water, and then squeezing the excess water out by closing your fists and wringing 
                out the bandage.
            </p>
            <p>Now the bandage can be placed on your subject as folllows.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Horizontally across the forehead</li>
                <li>Mid face with bottom edge at the nose tip (this slab should slightly overlap the first)</li>
                <li>Just below the nose (overlapping the ends of the last slab placed)</li>
                <li>Next starting at the top of neck and going underneath to the other side of the jaw</li>
                <li>The 5th slab will overlap 3 and 4 to cover any spots that were left uncovered under the jaw</li>
                <li>Use the smaller left over piece to reinforce the end of the nose</li>
            </ol> 
            <p>Plaster bandages typically take around 5 minutes to harden. Set your timer and keep your subject
                company, assuring them that the warmth they feel is just a part of the hardening process.

            <header>Removing The Life Mask Mold</header>
            <p>It's time to remove the life mask mold. Tell your 
                subject that you are ready but that they must remain still
                and follow these instructions implicitly.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Tell them to sit up and lean forward</li>
                <li>Instruct them to make faces, wiggle their nose, wrinkle their forehead, move jaw side to side (this will loosen the mask)</li>
                <li>Now tell them to stay still and allow you to do the pulling but to let you know if there are any areas that are sticking as you work the mask off</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now with both hands on each side of the mask, work slowly making sure the mother mold and alginate come off together. 
                Some patching can be done if needed but should be avoided if possible.

            <header>Casting The Life Mask</header>
            <p>There are some things that should first be addressed
                with your alginate mold before you make your cast. First you want 
                to check your alginate mold for any pieces that may need 
                to be repaired. Small tears in the alginate can be patched 
                with crazy glue, and water clay can be used to fill any gaps.
                You also want to plug the breathing holes with clay before casting. 
                Now you're ready to move on to casting.
            </p>
            <p>White hydrocal sets up and hardens quickly. Put a cup or two of water in 
                a plastic bowl, take a handful of hydrocal and sift it between your 
                fingers into the water. Do this until the gypsum starts to collect at 
                the top, looking like cracked wet mud. Mix with your hands, breaking up 
                chunks with your fingers, and mix for an additional minute after it becomes
                smooth. Hydrocal hardens quickly so you want to work pretty fast. Pour a small 
                amount into your alginate mold and then tilt your mold, coating the sides, getting 
                into the small crevices of your mold. Once this first layer starts to stiffen, use 
                a spatula to fill the rest of the mold.
            </p>
            <p>You want a half inch thick layer of hydrocal for your life cast. Once you have your 
                layers you can allow the gypsum to set, at first it will become hot, once it has cooled
                off it is set and can be de-molded....
